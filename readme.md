Introduction
-----------
Lambda (formerly FiftyOne) is a modern, high-definition theme for StepMania 5.x. It is designed to serve as the default theme for StepMania 5.1; it features a clean aesthetic with bold colors that reflects modern design trends, yet still maintains a suitable level of energy for a rhythm game. Under the hood, it's also a bit more future-proof than the previous theme, with certain screens featuring more prominent use of backend Lua code to replace legacy methods of rendering particular elements.

Progress
-----------
I'd say it's about 96% done now; just needs a bit more fit and finish if needed. Feel free to contribute and make pull requests. 


Source code
-----------
Inkscape SVG source code is available for the majority of graphics created in the _src folder on the repository used to develop it, located at https://github.com/ListenerJubatus/smtheme-fiftyOne. Some of the original mockups are also included for reference, although they are meant primarily for reference purposes due to changes in the theme's style since these mockups (such as the removal of rounded corners and increased use of chamfered edges and diamond motifs).

The main fonts are the current version of Roboto and Noto Sans <https://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/roboto-noto-fonts.html>, and Open Sans (although, preferably, Noto Sans should eventually be used in any location Open Sans is currently used). Certain accents make use of the font Overpass. <http://overpassfont.org/>


License
-----------
As it incorporates existing code from StepMania, and is intended to possibly be part of the main distribution, Lambda is licensed under the terms of the MIT License. 

Notice about branches
-----------
The master branch, as of April 10, 2017, is now the 5.0 branch that was created by Riakodoadm, and the previous version has been moved to a new "5.2" branch. This mirrors the similar rollback that StepMania itself performed.

Since the new 5.1 is meant to be more compatible with 5.0.x, you no longer need a nightly build to run this theme.
